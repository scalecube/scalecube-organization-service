# API documentation for the Organization Service
## Allows to:
     - create new organization, update it, inquiring the current state of it and be able to delete the organization
     - invite the members to organization and remove out each member from it
     - get know all the members steeped in the specified organization
     - leave the organization as the member and get know if specified member got the membership in any of the created organizations
     - grant and delete the permission level via API key (token) for members assigned by relevant role (Member/Admin/Owner) and change
       each of the role according to upgrade and downgrade possibility.

   Note: there are two kind types of the Organization ownership:
     <br> - first one belongs to origin owner who created the Organization and stored there as the relevant "owner" role which relies on ownerId.
       <br> In fact this kind of ownership couldn't be eliminated and the origin owner doesn't lose the full management control (permission level)
       upon the "owner" role was downgraded to "admin" or "member" either owner was removed from own Organization (kicked-out or leaved only as the member).
     <br> - second one is acquired "owner" role which is granted to the specified Organization's member.
       <br> As the result this kind of ownership could be downgraded and the delegated "owner" role loses the full management control (permission level)
       upon it was downgraded to "admin" or "member".
   <br> Only Owners and Admins of specified Organization could grant (upgrade/downgrade) relevant permission level to a specific member in the common Organization as do to add the API keys.
   Any defined name for specified key can only contain characters in range A-Z, a-z, 0-9 as well as underscore, period, dash & percent.
